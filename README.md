# AayzieGPT
scuffed LLM front-end that uses scale's spellbook API

## Notes

This is unfinished. Will update this more soon (maybe), but right now it should be at least functional.

## How to use

1) Make sure you have a Spellbook on Scale. If you don't have one yet, create one here: https://spellbook.scale.com/

2) Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/

3) Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Aayzie/AayzieGPT.git
```

4) Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd AayzieGPT
```

5) Install the required dependencies using the following command:
```
npm install
```

6) Create a new file named **.env** in the root of the project directory. Add the following environment variables and set their values according to your Scale.AI API credentials:
```
SCALE_API_URL=your_scale_api_url
SCALE_API_AUTHORIZATION=your_scale_api_authorization
```
Replace **your_scale_api_url** and **your_scale_api_authorization** with the appropriate values.

7) Start the server by running the following command:
```
npm start
```

8) Run **index.html**
