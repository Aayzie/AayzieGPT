# AayzieGPT
scuffed LLM front-end that uses scale's API

## Notes

This is unfinished. Will update this more soon (maybe), but right now it should be at least functional.

## How to use

1) Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/

2) Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Aayzie/AayzieGPT.git
```

3) Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd AayzieGPT
```

4) Install the required dependencies using the following command:
```
npm install
```

5) Create a new file named **.env** in the root of the project directory. Add the following environment variables and set their values according to your Scale.AI API credentials:
```
SCALE_API_URL=your_scale_api_url
SCALE_API_AUTHORIZATION=your_scale_api_authorization
```
Replace **your_scale_api_url** and **your_scale_api_authorization** with the appropriate values.

6) Start the server by running the following command:
```
npm start
```

7) Open your web browser and navigate to **http://localhost:3000** (or the port number you specified in your server configuration). You should see the application interface, and you can start using it.
